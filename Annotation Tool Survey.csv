I had to delete the whole pattern set and select again to add to that pattern set or modify it.  2) There seems to be a slight visual delay when compared to the sound of the note being played - I could not help feeling that it was one note off, but maybe that's just my lack of musical experience.",1) Easy to select patterns 2) Easy to control playback and selection area 3) Patern display is colourful and easy to spot - and the highlighting feature for each pattern is very good.,Yes... it picked out several patterns.,The abiity to modify or add to an already selected pattern once a new set of patterns was started.,4,"Visually it's easier, especially for a non-musician",It's an interesting tool.

2019/08/03 3:43:23 pm EET,Yes,05,22 - 28,Male,I enjoy listening to music; I can read sheet music; experience reading guitar tabulatures / lead sheets with chords and strumming patterns,Guitar,2,4,4,3,3,2,2,4,2,1,"1. It is annoying that confirmed marked patterns cannot be edited further but have to be redone from scratch if you made a mistake. Depending on the complexity of the sheet it can be quite bothering to reselect everything. Most importantly though, repititions of patterns with slight variations can be found easier if you only select the notes that are elementar for the patterns and then use ""find exact matches"". It would be very convenient if you could add to edit these matches (eliminating the flash icon on confirmation) to get all variations easily instead of manually having to select every variation to the pattern. 2. The UI... The confirmation is a bit of a bother before you find out that you can also press Enter to confirm as you need to aim rather well (I've managed to confirm a pattern i wanted to delete and vice versa at least once although I have a background in fast paced circle clicking activities). There should be additional tells for keyboard controls e.g. via tooltips but at least through a help menu that shows the available keyboard controls. Furthermore the currently active pattern could also have its pattern display vertically enlarged to allow for easier clicking. In conjunction with 1, the currently active subpattern could be lit up in the left pattern menu to show which subpattern is active and the respective subpattern in the piano view could also be permanently lit the same way it is now when hovering the subpattern. Subpatterns with lower confidence levels have no visual tells or other options right now. The option for assigning a lower confidence level is also fairly hard to reach so I would personally see no value in using it at this point. 3. Usability and responsiveness Using right-click -> Find Exact Occurences does not change the active pattern to the pattern you used that command for. Patterns that already contain more than 1 subpattern should require some way of confirmation before they can be deleted - otherwise it can happen easily that you wanted to either hide it or delete the last subpattern of the pattern above and whooosh, your work is gone. Naturally, adding autoscroll to the playback would be a great improvement. 4. Robustness and persistence Loading annotations seems to be very fragile right now. For some correct midi+jams pairs I get the message ""Annotation data does not match MIDI file!"" although it does and it actually loads it properly after. For other correct pairs the application crashes (which makes me think ""have fun evaluating everyone's submissions when you can't load half of them o_o"") and for incorrect pairs the application crashes too. Loading and saving midi files and jams files separately does not make a lot of sense. With the current example, the filesize of the annotation files is several times bigger than the size of the respective .midi. As such I think it would be legitimate to either a) add a section for the used midi file to the specification of .jams so you can always be 100% sure to work with the correct midi file b) save a hash of the midi file to the ""file_metadata"" so you can keep them seperately but still perform proper validation and add a relational database for easy search access to quickly determine whether the .jams file will work for the selected midi. With that approach you could immediately offer a list of possible .jams files upon loading a midi so you get past the annoying double file-select before being able to do anything. I can imagine that you didn't do this because you wanted to have the option to add more stuff to a midi and keep the annotations working for it but I think in the current state of the app you would have to do too much validation for that to be feasible and approach a) would still allow you to follow such an approach in a more reasonable way as you can actually check exactly what was altered / deleted. I think the logs you added are mainly for evaluating usage of the tool by the participants so I'm not gonna dig into it too much but Undo/Redo functionality would be nice and also cancel out the problem with deleting patterns in a single misclick.",1. Selecting patterns with both dragging boxes and clicking without having to like hold shift or ctrl to add was quite nice and intuitive. 2. The navigation to a subpattern when you click on it is good 3. Playback functionality worked nicely with dragging on the measure bar and using spacebar for start/pause,Semi helpful. It was decent for melodies but bad for rhythms and variations. I often marked things manually if it was immediately visible that it was essentially the same.,See the big text at #17,2,because usually when i want to find patterns i want to pay attention to it in my practice and performance and i would need the tells in my sheets regardless while the tool is kinda neat it lacks some flexibility in form that you have on paper and it lives and dies with having a midi-file available,
